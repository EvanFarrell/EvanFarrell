hey! call me ev. im currently the cto @ carde.io, where we're building a platform for tcg publishers to provide them with tournament software, deckbuilding tools, physical warehousing & distribution, and player analytics. we're like steam. they allow game designers focus on building a great game, and not have to worry about all the nuts and bolts around distribution, updates, marketing, player management and transaction processing. we're doing the same, for physical trading card games. 

previously, i dropped out of college to start my first startup (path.me), which went through y combinator in 2019. we raised 7mm, built a bank, and helped students get over 100mm in financial aid for college. after path i built spicerack.gg, which quickly became the most popular event search tool for magic the gathering, and our tournament software + app is still actively used at almost every north american mtg convention. i sold spicerack to carde.io in 2025 and joined to run the engineering dept.
